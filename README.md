## Project's goal

The project's goal is to realize a website containing a game based on the popular mobile phone "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draw_Something">Draw something</a>" application, based on the "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pictionary">Pictionnary</a>" guessing word game itself.

The game's progression is pretty simple:

1. the game requires 2 or more players to start;
2. in rotation, one of the players becomes "designer";
3. the game gives the designer one word haphazarldy;
4. the designer must draw a representation of the given word;
5. remaining players must guess the word with the drawing (in a limited amount of attemps).

The game's winner is the one who scores the most points. There is 2 manners to win points:

1. as a designer: one of the remaining players guess the word (+ X points);
2. as a non-designer: guess the word (+ X * 5 points).

The game ends after some turns (1 turn means everyone was 1 time designer) or when a player got a points' threshold.
